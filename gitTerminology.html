                <dt>Version Control Software</dt>
                <dd>Version Control, also known as source or revision control, is the monitoring, organization and management of changes to a base of information, particularly computer programs, web sites and applications, and documents. It is essential to
                    multi-editor projects, and greatly beneficial to individual endeavors as well. </dd>
                <dt>Git</dt>
                <dd>Git is a distributed revision control system that supports non-linear development and is used for software and application development. It was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds and is maintained by Junio Hamano, and now is the most widely
                    used source code management system among software developers. </dd>
                <dt>Repository</dt>
                <dd>A repository is where files' current and historical data is stored. This can be placed on a server or placed in a shared cloud service, such as BitBucket</dd>
                <dt>Stage</dt>
                <dd>A stage is an index or a cache under constant change and is used to store information about the working directory as well as the changes being made to it that will become the next committed revision. It is a connection point between the
                    working tree and object database.</dd>
                <dt>Commit</dt>
                <dd>To commit is to write or merge the changes from the working copy of a file into the repository</dd>
                <dt>Push</dt>
                <dd>A push is to copy revisions initiated by the source repository into a recieving or user's repository</dd>
                <dt>Pull</dt>
                <dd>The opposite of a push, a pull is a user initiated copy of revisions into a repository. </dd>
                <dt>Revert</dt>
                <dd>To revert is to move backwards in historical data and changes to a version of the repository prior to the current commit. </dd>
                <dt>Branching</dt>
                <dd>Branching is pulling a repository and editing the code independently. Once the code is sufficiently altered, it is merged back into the repository</dd>
                <dt>Merging</dt>
                <dd>Merging or integration is the point where sets of changes are evaluated and applied accordingly to a set of files in the repository.</dd>
                <dt>Change History</dt>
                <dd>The change history is the list of modifications performed on the data or code in the file or repository.</dd>
                <dt>Clone/Cloned</dt>
                <dd>A clone is a duplication of data and revisions from one repository into another. If pushing or pulling a populated or active repository into an empty or newly created one, that is considered a clone. Two repositories that have identical
                    revisions are also considered to be clones. </dd>
